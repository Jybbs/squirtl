Pins the isolation the suite keeps from the machine running it, covering:

- The shell variables each test starts without
- The home directory each test reads
- The block that stops a test without the `network` mark from opening a
  network connection, and the Unix socket that block leaves open
- The mark that lets a `network` test open a connection
- The filter that raises every warning as an error
