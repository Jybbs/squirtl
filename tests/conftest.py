Sets the example count on Hypothesis's built-in profiles, two hundred under
the `ci` profile Hypothesis loads on a CI runner and twenty-five under
`default`. The `default` profile also drops the deadline, as `ci` already
does, so a heavily loaded machine fails no test a runner passes. It also
defines the fixtures the suite shares, each described where it is defined.

The autouse `environment` fixture isolates every test from the machine
running it, and the collection hook lets a test open a network connection
only when it carries the `network` mark.
